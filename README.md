# Smart Inventory 
Smart Inventory is designed to streamline the process of tracking equipment in college laboratories. It allows faculty members to raise tickets to technicians, initiating the process of resolving issues efficiently. The platform eliminates the need for lengthy procedures, such as filling out forms manually, by providing a centralized digital solution.

This project simplifies issue reporting and management, making it quick and hassle-free for both faculty and technicians.
